# Phase 1 verification report

Recorded 2026-10-25. Python 3.12.10 was newly installed after the user authorized installation. The standalone repository is `C:\src\Chinescan`; the parent repository was not staged or changed.

## Outcome

Platform foundation implemented: package metadata and lock, versioned records and schemas, config, redaction and JSON logging, protocols and fake scanner, SQLite repository and Alembic migration, Typer CLI, tests, project policies/docs, Compose, and CI workflow.

The initial acceptance run had a Docker wheel-install failure and left the base image tag unpinned. On 2026-10-25, the Dockerfile was corrected to preserve the built wheel's filename and pinned to the verified Python image manifest digest. The complete Docker build and container CLI smoke check now pass. The latest Python acceptance rerun also passes lint, formatting, type checks, unit tests, dependency audit, CLI checks, and Compose validation. Exact rerun results are recorded below.

## Tasks and verification

| Plan task | Result | Verification / note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Python gate, standalone Git repository, conventions | PASS | `py -0` and `py -3.12 --version` passed; nested `git init` and status passed. |
| 2. Project metadata and lock | PASS | `uv lock --check`; `uv sync --locked --extra dev`; `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` committed as `50d04e9`. |
| 3. Typed errors, canonical models, schemas | PASS | Pydantic model tests and both JSON Schema JSON parse checks passed. |
| 4. TOML config, environment overrides, safe init | PASS | Configuration tests passed, including environment override and no-secret initialization. |
| 5. Redaction, structured logging, focused tests | PASS | Redaction and JSON formatter tests passed. |
| 6. Protocols, fake adapter, SQLite, Alembic | PASS | Fake adapter and temporary SQLite repository tests passed; migration created the `records` table. |
| 7. Typer CLI and future stubs | PASS | CLI tests, help, version, config commands, and Phase 3 stub exit code 2 passed. |
| 8. Example config, docs, decisions, license, policies | PASS | Files created; reviewed as source artifacts. |
| 9. Docker, Compose, `.dockerignore`, CI | PASS | `docker compose ... config --quiet` passed; digest-pinned Docker build and container `--help` smoke check passed. |
| 10. Acceptance checks and report | PASS | Python 3.12.10 checks, CLI/config, tests, lint/format, mypy, pip-audit, schemas, migration, Compose, and Docker build passed; see rerun results below. |

## Exact verification commands and results

### Python gate

`py -0` — exit 0:

```text

 -V:3.12          Python 3.12 (64-bit)
 -V:3.11          Python 3.11 (64-bit)
 -V:3.10          Python 3.10 (64-bit)
```

`py -3.12 --version` — exit 0:

```text
Python 3.12.10
```

### Python checks

| Command | Exit | Output |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `\.venv312\Scripts\uv.exe sync --locked --extra dev` | 0 | `Using CPython 3.12.10`; `Resolved 54 packages`; installed locked project and development dependencies, including pytest 9.1.1. |
| `\.venv312\Scripts\uv.exe lock --check` | 0 | `Resolved 54 packages in 2ms` |
| `\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check .` | 0 | `All checks passed!` |
| `\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe chinescan` | 0 | `Success: no issues found in 23 source files` |
| `\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe --cov=chinescan --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80` | 0 | 17 passed; total coverage 89.26%; required 80% reached. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\pip-audit.exe --skip-editable` | 0 | `No known vulnerabilities found`; editable local `chinescan` distribution skipped. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe --help` | 0 | Help listed `version`, `scan`, `report`, and `config`. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe version` | 0 | `0.1.0` |
| `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m json.tool schemas\finding.schema.json > $null` | 0 | Valid JSON. |
| `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m json.tool schemas\investigation.schema.json > $null` | 0 | Valid JSON. |

The first audit found `PYSEC-2026-1845` in pytest 8.4.2 (fix listed as 9.0.3). The dev dependency upper bound was widened from `<9` to `<10`, the lock was upgraded to pytest 9.1.1, and the audit then passed.

### Persistence and container configuration

| Command | Exit | Output |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Temporary Alembic upgrade script using `alembic.command.upgrade(cfg, 'head')` | 0 | `migration upgrade head: OK; records table present` |
| `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet` | 0 | No errors. |
| `docker info` | 0 | Docker Engine 29.9.2 server responded; daemon available. |
| `docker image inspect python:3.12-slim --format '{{json .RepoDigests}}'` | 1 | `Error response from daemon: No such image: python:3.12-slim` |
| Docker build | NOT RUN | Registry fetch was not attempted because network use is limited to package indexes. Therefore Docker daemon unavailability is not claimed. |

## Deviations and decisions

- The planned pytest `<9` range was unsafe per the audit result; it is now `>=8.3,<10`, with 9.1.1 locked.
- An existing `.venv` using Python 3.13.15 was unintentionally replaced by `uv sync` with the Python 3.12.10 project environment. `.venv312` contains the uv executable used for environment management. This local environment change is recorded in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.
- The initial pytest runs used pytest's default system temporary directory for `tmp_path` fixtures. Before the final run, pytest was configured with `--basetemp=tests/.pytest-tmp` so subsequent test files are confined to the project. No cleanup was attempted outside the project directory.
- The initial Docker build failed because the built wheel was copied to `/tmp/chinescan.whl`, which is not a valid wheel filename. The Dockerfile now copies the wheel to `/tmp/` without renaming it. The Python 3.12 slim Bookworm base was resolved from Docker Hub and pinned by manifest digest in both stages; the digest-pinned build passes.
- Only `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` were committed, as directed by plan task 2. No other files were committed or pushed.

Error cases return documented application exit code 2. Temporary file removed. |

The earlier formatter failure has been corrected by applying Ruff formatting to the five reported files. Docker registry access was available for this rerun, so the prior package-index-only limitation no longer applies to the current verification.

## Rerun commands

From `C:\src\Chinescan` in PowerShell:

```powershell
\.venv312\Scripts\uv.exe sync --locked --extra dev
\.venv312\Scripts\uv.exe lock --check
\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check .
\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe chinescan
\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe --cov=chinescan --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
\.venv\Scripts\pip-audit.exe --skip-editable
\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe --help
\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe version
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet
```

Run the Alembic migration check through the pytest suite; pytest writes temporary databases under `tests/.pytest-tmp/`. The Docker image build command, after an authorized immutable base digest and registry access are available, is:

```powershell
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t chinescan:0.1.0 .
```

## Security and acceptance rerun — 2026-10-25

The following checks were rerun from `C:\src\Chinescan` with Python 3.12.10 after the secret-redaction and config-initialization fixes. The worktree also contains uncommitted Phase 2–4 code; results below describe that combined local worktree and do not make those features part of Phase 1.

| Command | Exit | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `py -0` | 0 | Registered interpreters: Python 3.13 (64-bit, default), 3.12 (64-bit), 3.11 (64-bit), 3.10 (64-bit) |

| Trivy full image report without `--ignore-unfixed` | 0 (report-only) | 44 high OS findings: 43 `affected`, one `fix_deferred`, none had a fixed version; no critical or Python-library findings. See the temporary acceptance in `docs/reports/security-review.md`. |
| `gitleaks git . --log-opts=--all --redact --no-banner` | 0 | Two Git commits scanned; no leaks |
| Gitleaks scans of tracked/unignored source paths | 0 | No leaks in source paths. A broad scan including ignored `.venv` produced 202 potential matches, all under that generated environment; they were not confirmed as credentials and were not staged. |

The full Bandit run still reports three low-severity items in uncommitted later-phase code. The Trivy workflow reports all high/critical image findings and fails only when a fix is available; the accepted no-fix OS findings have owner `CipherChi` and review date `2026-11-25` in the security review report. No repository settings, visibility, commits, pushes, pull requests, or deployments were changed or created in this run.

Exact `py -0` output:

 -V:3.10          Python 3.10 (64-bit)
```

## Acceptance rerun — 2026-10-26

This rerun validates the current combined worktree, which includes uncommitted later-phase modules;
it does not expand Phase 1's scope. Python commands explicitly used the 3.12 launcher. `PYTHONPATH`
was pointed at the repository virtual environment's installed dependencies because system Python
3.12 does not have the project dependencies installed.

The initial Phase 1 report above retains its original dated results for audit history. This is the
latest full acceptance snapshot. No production target or external domain was contacted.

### Parser update acceptance — 2026-10-26

The full acceptance suite was rerun after adding support for classic syslog-prefixed CEF records.
This remains later-phase parser functionality in the combined worktree; Phase 1 scope is unchanged.

## Current audit acceptance rerun — 2026-10-26

These results were collected during the read-only development-status audit of the current
combined worktree. No application code was edited. Tests used the existing installed
environment; no dependency installation or image build was performed.

and Bandit in this specific rerun. No production target or external domain was contacted.

## Local workflow hardening verification — 2026-10-26

The implementation run used the existing Python 3.12 environment and local tools. No
dependencies were installed and no images were fetched or built. The focused regression
suite first reported one test expectation error after missing explicitly selected config
files were made fatal; the test was corrected to cover the default-config-absent case. The
final full suite below passed.

| Command | Exit | Exact result |
| --- | ---: | --- |

| `py -3.12 -m json.tool schemas\investigation.schema.json > $null` | 0 | Valid JSON. |
| `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet` | 0 | No output; valid Compose configuration. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe --help` | 0 | Help includes global `--config` and `--database` options and existing commands. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe version` | 0 | `0.1.0`. |
| `\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe scan` | 2 | PowerShell `$LASTEXITCODE` was `2`; expected Phase 3 explicit stub. |
| `docker run --rm --network none chinescan:phase4-syslog-cef --help` | 0 | Existing local image rendered CLI help offline. The image was not rebuilt and does not include this worktree's new global options. |

Regression coverage added for shared archive expansion limits across multiple gzip inputs,
strict per-read byte bounds, an understated ZIP size declaration, malformed archives,
output overflow on both scanner streams, subprocess timeout/cancellation/JSON/exit paths,
settings precedence and secret redaction, validation before database creation, fresh and
legacy SQLite schemas, retained records, and incompatible-schema preservation. Ordinary
log fixture tests continue to pass. When the expanded-byte cap is reached, the member
using the remaining budget is rejected and all later inputs are skipped; previously parsed
events are retained.

Not run: Docker image build, remote CI, live domain probing, actual third-party scanner
binaries, or optional YARA/ClamAV binaries. The Docker build was skipped because it may
fetch images; no external targets or services were contacted. The timeout/cancel/output
tests use controlled local Python helpers or process doubles.

Known limits: output caps apply separately to stdout and stderr, and process termination
targets the direct scanner child (not an independently daemonized descendant). A legacy
database is accepted only for the exact initial table shape; other versions require an
explicit future migration. The migration downgrade in `0001_initial` still drops the
records table, so downgrade commands must not be used on data-bearing databases.


## Local investigation workflow verification — 2026-10-26

The local case workflow stage adds persisted case status and severity, typed links to existing
records, append-only notes and activity, ordered timelines, and redacted JSON/Markdown/HTML case
reports. `0002_case_workflow` is an application-payload revision over the existing generic JSON
record table; it does not rewrite payloads or change physical tables. Legacy unversioned stores
with the exact recognized initial schema are stamped at `0001_initial` and then upgraded to head.
Incompatible schemas are rejected without recreation. The report and schema are updated. No
production readiness is claimed.

A direct `py -3.12 -m chinescan.cli.app --help` attempt returned exit 1 because the standalone
Python 3.12 interpreter does not have the project dependencies on its import path (`ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'typer'`). The equivalent existing-environment entry point, `& .\.venv\Scripts\chinescan.exe
--help` and `case --help`, passed as listed above. No JSON Schema metaschema validator was configured;
only JSON parsing was run.

The suite covers ordinary fixture-driven local ingestion, persisted/missing/dangling links, unsupported
non-persisted artifacts, invalid status transitions, note bounds, redaction and HTML escaping, deterministic
timelines and missing ingestion times, atomic report-write failures, fresh database creation, retained
legacy payloads through the supported upgrade, and incompatible schema preservation.

Docker image build was **NOT RUN** because it may fetch base images and the user did not authorize image
fetches. No live scanner, public target, malware execution, or upload was used. JSON parsing does not
establish full JSON Schema metaschema conformance. The migration stores notes/activity inside one JSON
case record; it has no relational foreign keys, and ingestion timestamps and structured remediation
content remain unavailable. Case author labels are unverified. This is local workflow validation, not a
production-readiness assessment.

Recommended next stage: define and test local data retention, backup/restore, and export handling for
case records, including recovery against a copied database and explicit policy for sensitive report files.


## Local data protection and recovery verification — 2026-10-26

Implemented a local recovery bundle and a dry-run backup retention planner. Backups use SQLite's
online backup API through a read-only source connection, stage a standalone database plus a
versioned manifest, verify them, and publish only at a new path. Manifest SHA-256 detects a mismatch
with the manifest; it is not authentication. Verification is read-only and distinguishes structural
errors, unsupported schema, and application consistency issues. It explicitly checks case links,
note/activity references, typed records, scan relationships, and other persisted links because case
links do not have SQL foreign keys. Restore requires a fully verified bundle, stages to a new file,
and runs existing Alembic migrations only on that staged copy. No database migration revision or
stored record format changed in this stage.

The recovery drill created local log-analysis records, a linked case, notes and status activity; created
and verified a backup; restored to a new path; reopened it through `SQLiteRepository`; compared case
IDs, status, links, notes, and activities; and rendered JSON, Markdown, and HTML reports. Separate
tests cover committed WAL data, missing source without accidental creation, existing destinations,
active database and hard-link aliases, cancellation and timeout staging cleanup, truncated/corrupt and
checksum-mismatched files, unsupported revisions, unversioned and 0001 legacy schemas, retained
payloads, dangling/invalid case relationships, invalid payloads, symlink-safe retention preview, and
case export no-overwrite behavior. CLI smoke checks completed `trends`, `db backup`, `db verify-backup`,
`db restore`, and `db retention-plan` using a temporary database; each exited 0 and the backup reported
`verified: true` at revision `0002_case_workflow`.

External dependency audit was **NOT RUN** because it would contact an advisory service and the request
forbids external requests without approval. No packages were installed. Docker image build was **NOT
RUN** because it may fetch images. No network target, external scanner, or malware sample was used.

Known limits: backups and exports are not encrypted. Checksums do not authenticate a bundle. Windows
mode-bit requests do not establish ACL protections; operators must review ACLs. Redaction is not
anonymization. Backup bundles preserve original sensitive records. Case links are checked at verify
time but remain without SQL foreign keys. Retention only previews; no backups or records are deleted.
A restore is published as a new file; active database replacement/cutover remains operator-controlled.
Case export publication uses same-directory hard links to prevent overwrite, so filesystems without
hard-link support fail closed. No production readiness is claimed.

Recommended next stage: conduct an operator-controlled cutover and rollback drill using a restored
copy, with documented downtime, database-path change, user verification, and recovery checkpoints.


## Recovery acceptance and operator cutover drill — 2026-10-26

Added `scripts/recovery_acceptance.py` and the operator sequence in `docs/RECOVERY-RUNBOOK.md`.
The script creates synthetic scan/log records and a case inside a temporary directory, closes the
repository before backup, creates and verifies a bundle, restores to a new database, and runs case
show, note list, timeline, and JSON/Markdown/HTML exports through the CLI with an explicit
`--database` path for each invocation. It adds a unique note only to the restored copy, selects the
original again, and verifies the original hash and case data remain intact. The restored-only note
remains divergent in the restored database; selecting the original does not merge it. The configuration
file is not changed, and neither the original nor backup bundle is replaced.

The drill refuses to invoke case commands against a missing selected file because ordinary
repository startup may initialize a database. This preflight prevents accidental creation within
the acceptance script; it does not change general CLI initialization behavior.

The suite also verifies a failed/corrupt backup cannot be restored, missing drill database selection
does not create a file, restored-only notes are absent from the original, original and restored paths
are not confused, and failed case-report publication removes its temporary file. Supported migration
behavior is covered by the focused migration/recovery tests. A permission-denied destination test was
not run because reliable ACL denial is environment and privilege dependent on this Windows host.

**Recovery acceptance verdict: PASS for the bounded local synthetic drill.** This verifies local
application behavior only. It does not prove that unrelated processes have closed the database, that
a backup is authentic or encrypted, or that an operational cutover is production ready. Backup and
reports remain unencrypted, Windows ACLs require separate review, links lack SQL foreign keys, report
publication needs same-directory hard-link support, retention is preview-only, and divergent writes
are not merged. No network-backed audit or image build was run; no dependency was installed or
external service contacted.

Recommended next stage: controlled real scanner integration verification with authorized local
fixtures and isolated helper processes.

## Separate-project scanning guide verification — 2026-10-26

Added `docs/SCANNING-ANOTHER-PROJECT.md` after inspecting the current CLI, code scanner, external adapters, settings/configuration, SQLite path handling, reporting, and development documentation. Verification used only `fixtures/sample-python-project`; no real separate project, external scanner, domain, advisory service, or downloaded database was used.

NOT RUN: dependency advisory audit because it contacts external advisory services; Docker build because it may fetch images; all actual external scanner executions; scanning from a separate live target; and runtime web assessment. The CLI invocations and outputs above verify local scan and Markdown report mechanics only. No application code was changed for this guide.

Additional exact working-directory check: from `C:\src\Chinescan\fixtures\sample-python-project`, `& $exe --database $db code . --format json` exited 0 and returned scan ID `0176dc24-673a-4472-b4ed-802104760390`, three findings, and no failures (`$exe` was the absolute ChineScan executable and `$db` the external database path). From that same working directory, `& $exe --database $db report 0176dc24-673a-4472-b4ed-802104760390 --format markdown --output 'C:\scan-results\my-application\scan-0176dc24-673a-4472-b4ed-802104760390.md'` exited 0 and wrote a 687-byte report outside the fixture.

## Offline verification — 2026-10-26

Commands ran from `C:\src\Chinescan` with Python 3.12.10. To use the existing Python 3.12

No dependencies were installed. Gitleaks was unavailable, so a local credential-pattern scan examined
147 intended files without printing matched contents. It reported three expected synthetic patterns
under `fixtures/real-scanners/gitleaks-positive/credential.txt`,
`fixtures/sample-python-project/app.py`, and `tests/integration/test_real_scanners.py`; no operational
database, backup, environment-secret, or investigation-export filenames were found. This pattern
scan is not a substitute for Gitleaks. Docker, external scanner, and network-backed checks were not
run.

## Merge verification — 2026-10-26

## Authenticated dashboard Slice 1 verification — 2026-10-26

Added FastAPI, Uvicorn, argon2-cffi, and the Starlette-compatible `httpx2` API test transport to
the existing `uv` project environment. Added React/React DOM, Vite, TypeScript, React typings,
Vitest, jsdom, and Testing Library to `frontend/`. Direct dependencies are recorded in
`pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json`; exact resolutions are recorded in `uv.lock` and
`frontend/package-lock.json`. A lock comparison confirmed that no previously locked Python package

The API tests exercise CLI bootstrap and repository-path rejection, protected reads, real SQLite

validation limits, CSRF rejection, login throttling, host/origin rejection, session expiry, logout
revocation, new-application session invalidation, and fixed loopback/single-worker startup options.
The component tests exercise unauthorized login, backend-loaded metrics, and honest empty states.
Browser-level verification was **NOT RUN**; no browser binaries were downloaded. Domain probes,
external scanners, and other external services were not run.

`pip-audit` was **NOT RUN** because it queries an external advisory service, outside the approved
package-download scope. During initial npm package installation, npm also emitted its default
registry audit output (`0 vulnerabilities`); the final acceptance install used `--no-audit`.

## Chinetscan dashboard Slice 2 verification — 2026-10-26

The authenticated dashboard now exposes persisted cases and report downloads through the existing
`CaseWorkflow` and reporting renderers. No dependencies were installed or upgraded for Slice 2; the
existing lockfiles remain consistent.

The five deselected tests are marked `real_scanner` by `tests/integration/test_real_scanners.py` and
are intentionally excluded by `tests/conftest.py`; they require external scanner binaries and
integration conditions that were not part of this local dashboard verification. No external
services were contacted.

Browser verification was **NOT PERFORMED**. The in-app browser control was available, but its local
browser view attach timed out. Checks for installed Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Chromium executables
returned none. No browser binary was downloaded. To run the requested full browser smoke, approval is
needed to install a compatible Chromium-based browser binary and, if the existing browser control
remains unavailable, a Playwright-compatible browser test runtime and its browser package. The live
HTTP harness is API verification and is not represented as browser testing.

## Chinetscan dashboard browser acceptance — 2026-10-26

This section supersedes the earlier NOT PERFORMED note above. The user approved only the npm
registry packages required for `@playwright/test` and Playwright's official Chromium assets. The
frontend lockfile now resolves `@playwright/test` 1.64.1. `npx playwright install chromium` downloaded
Chrome for Testing 156.0.8078.4 and the matching Playwright headless shell from Playwright's official
distribution. No package or browser was installed globally. The `npm install` and clean `npm ci`
commands both used `--no-audit`.

The browser harness serves the actual built `frontend/dist` from `create_app` using a temporary
SQLite database containing synthetic scans, findings, and an event. It generates random operator
credentials under a unique temporary directory, starts two Python services on ephemeral
`127.0.0.1` ports, uses only loopback requests, and removes the services and temporary directories
after each run. Credential values, cookies, browser profiles, and Playwright artifacts are not
tracked. Browser traces and screenshots are configured for failures only; the successful run
produced no failure artifacts.

external target, advisory service, or external upload was used. The browser suite explicitly checked
that its intentional pre-login/session-expiry 401s and invalid-scan 404 were the only failed API
responses, with no unexpected browser console errors or server errors.

**Browser acceptance verdict: PASS** for the requested dashboard Slices 1 and 2 workflows against
the production frontend and local authenticated backend.

## Dashboard Slice 3A — local code-assessment jobs — 2026-10-26

Implemented an operator TOML project registry, authenticated and CSRF-protected job creation,
persisted job state, one worker with four waiting slots, startup interruption reconciliation, bounded
job listing/detail, and a dashboard form/list with two-second polling while active jobs are present.
The dashboard uses only `BuiltinRuleScanner` through `CodeScanService`; optional engines and
network-backed dependency checks cannot be requested. Jobs return a scan ID only after the service
has persisted the scan and result records. The UI opens the persisted scan and finding IDs and uses
the existing case workflow. Project IDs, names, and roots are operator configured outside the
browser; API responses omit full paths and raw logs.

Path validation resolves configured roots strictly and excludes the database directory, operator
credential file, and registry file. It rejects symlinked path components and symlink/junction entries
found during a preflight tree walk. The existing scanner does not follow directory symlinks and skips
symlink files. This remains vulnerable to a time-of-check/time-of-use change after validation; it is
not OS filesystem isolation. Built-in scanning has file-count and byte bounds but no safely
interruptible wall-clock timeout. Graceful shutdown waits for active work. A restarted server marks
persisted queued/running jobs interrupted without asserting that an OS process was terminated.

The five deselected Python tests require real optional scanner binaries. They were not run. No
dependency was installed, scanner or rules database downloaded, external target contacted, or
network-backed audit performed. Queue bounds, duplicate active project submission, failed scanner
and persistence outcomes, auth/CSRF, unknown project, missing/protected roots, symlink rejection,
restart reconciliation, and no fixture modification have focused backend tests. Browser acceptance
used only synthetic local fixture source and the existing Playwright installation.

Known limitations: queue depth is fixed at four waiting jobs; there is no cancellation or progress
percentage; built-in scans have no hard elapsed-time limit; abrupt filesystem changes can race the
preflight walk; scan writes are existing per-record repository operations rather than a new atomic
multi-record transaction. This slice does not claim comprehensive security coverage or production
readiness. Recommended next stage: design and verify a cancellable, resource-limited worker boundary
with atomic scan-result publication before adding additional assessment types.

The final isolated Playwright retry `npx playwright test -c playwright.config.ts --project=chromium-session-expiry`
exited 1 before executing tests: the Python dashboard fixture did
not start within its 60-second harness startup window (no server stderr was emitted). This is an
harness-level startup timeout with undetermined cause, separate from the 15-second session expiry
observed in the preceding full-suite rerun. The complete job workflow itself passed in both
full-suite reruns.

## Dashboard Slice 3A stabilization — 2026-10-26

Root cause separation: the earlier expiry failure happened in the dedicated 15-second session
fixture while the Overview transition was still in progress. The standard dashboard fixture has its
own 1,800-second TTL. The existing captured output does not establish why the separate local Python
fixture failed to announce readiness within 60 seconds; it emitted no stderr, so that event is
classified as an undiagnosed fixture startup failure, not attributed to the host. No authentication
bypass, retry, or longer production session lifetime was introduced.

The browser harness now captures bounded diagnostics (last 4,000 characters per output stream),
checks early process exit, confirms Python 3.12 and repository-root working directory through its
explicit `py -3.12` launch, uses the server's OS-assigned loopback port, and requires an actual HTTP
401 from `/api/auth/session` before declaring readiness. One reproduction printed its URL just after
the previous 60-second announcement bound; the bounded announcement window is now 120 seconds, with
a separate 10-second HTTP readiness bound. Failed setup and normal teardown terminate only the
test-owned process tree and remove its temporary data. The existing real 15-second expiry and
server-side 401 behavior are unchanged; expiry uses observable request/session conditions, not a
fixed sleep. Playwright retries remain disabled.

A later browser failure snapshot showed the production page still displaying `Signing in…` when the
test asserted Overview content. The production browser test now waits for a successful login
response and the visible Overview heading before checking stored records; it does not expand global
expectation or session timeouts.

Project roots automatically exclude the active SQLite parent directory (database and sidecars),
operator credentials, and registry. Operator `protected_paths` remains available for additional
backup/report storage. This dashboard has no managed backup or report/export directory; reports are
generated in memory. Roots are strictly resolved, link/junction entries are rejected where
supported, overlap checks work in both directions, and registry/tree checks run again before
execution. The filesystem check/open race remains and this is not sandbox isolation.

The scanner previously omitted individual source files over 1 MB, which could look like a clean
result. It now reports that input-limit exhaustion as a scan failure. Existing limits are 1 MB per
source, 20,000 source files, and 250 MB aggregate source bytes. The queue allows four waiting jobs;
one worker executes at a time. These are separate from elapsed-time limits and cancellation, neither
of which exists. Graceful shutdown waits for an active scan. Restart reconciliation marks unfinished
jobs interrupted but does not prove process termination. Failed scan-result persistence produces a
sanitized failed job record. A hard deadline needs a worker-process boundary and is outside this
stabilization.

The five deselected tests are the opt-in tests in `tests/integration/test_real_scanners.py`; they
require the actual Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, YARA, and ClamAV executables, plus local Trivy/ClamAV
database assets. These are deliberately not installed or fetched during this run.

No dependencies were installed, no external service was contacted, and no real scanner was run.
Browser acceptance is qualified to the local synthetic fixture and these three consecutive clean
suite runs. Worker execution still has no hard deadline or cancellation, and filesystem path checks
do not provide an OS sandbox.

## Dashboard release verification — 2026-10-26

Current local verification for the stabilized dashboard release scope. The five real-scanner tests
remain deselected; they require Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, YARA, and ClamAV binaries (and local Trivy
or ClamAV data where applicable). No real scanner or remote target was used.

The first browser acceptance attempt failed before tests because the Windows Python launcher did not
inherit the project environment's Uvicorn dependency. The harness now adds the local Windows
environment only when using `py`; CI supplies its locked `.venv` interpreter explicitly. The
complete browser run above passed after that correction. Failure diagnostics omit the harness
stdout because it contains generated login credentials. `npm ci --no-audit` remains enforced in
CI; local verification used the already installed dependencies and did not reinstall packages.

## Dashboard Stage A — authenticated local log-analysis jobs — 2026-10-27

The web server now accepts an operator-selected log-source registry through the explicit
`--log-sources-file` option (default `~/.config/chinescan/log-sources.toml`). API clients submit
only a configured source ID. Jobs use `LogAnalysisService` directly with the existing parser,
normalization, local detection, IOC matching, and persistence path. The manager persists queue and
terminal states, partial diagnostics, and the actual result scan ID. One worker runs at a time with
four waiting jobs, and abandoned queued/running jobs reconcile as `interrupted` at startup. No new
database revision or package dependency was required.

Authenticated result routes expose bounded alert, event, and timeline pages and reviewed alert/event
details scoped to the selected log scan. Responses omit raw event references and full paths. The
frontend selects approved sources, starts and polls jobs, shows partial diagnostics, pages and filters
results, creates cases, links alerts/events, and retains stored records across refresh. The synthetic
browser fixture includes malformed content and verifies that the job is visibly `partial`; its
redacted case report still contains available evidence. Original fixture bytes are hash-checked by
the backend test. No original logs are modified or uploaded.

The new tests exercise unknown source rejection, request path/additional-field rejection, unavailable
and protected roots, queue exhaustion, restart interruption reconciliation, protected unauthenticated
access, CSRF behavior, path-free API responses, pagination bounds, event case linking, report
download, and unchanged input hashes. Existing log-analysis tests cover bounded ingestion, compressed
archive expansion, parser errors, and event limits. A dedicated browser polling-expiry scenario was
not added; existing browser session-expiry coverage verifies protected action denial and return to
sign-in. Resource termination is not guaranteed after abrupt process loss, and the worker has no
cancellation or hard execution deadline. No external scanner, network collector, advisory service,
or remote target was used.

## Stage B1 backend verification — 2026-10-27

The fixtures were harmless synthetic files only. B1 is backend-only: no web routes, browser uploads,
case links, downloads, deletion controls, or external services were added. Five tests marked
`real_scanner` were deselected because they require Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, YARA, and ClamAV
assets; no real scanner binary was verified or called by B1.

| `git diff --check` | 0 | Passed; Git printed existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices. |

Windows test evidence is separated by type. Actual host tests passed for the fixed worker under a
configured Job Object, persisted analysis through that worker, and termination of a synthetic
Python parent/child process tree. Mocked tests separately passed timeout, output-overflow, and
pipe-cleanup control paths. Migration preservation, atomic queue claim, five-slot queue limit,
bounded intake, source/object mutation detection, publication-failure orphan handling, restart
reconciliation, and restore with a missing managed object passed in the Python suite.

**Worker guarantees:** On this Windows host, the implementation created and queried a Job Object,
applied 512 MiB per-process and 768 MiB aggregate committed-memory limits, a four-process tree cap,
a 60-second Job user CPU-time limit, and kill-on-last-handle-close. It assigned the worker and
verified assignment before sending the sample path. The parent enforces a 60-second wall deadline,
3 MiB output/result caps, and termination on timeout or overflow. The fixed child receives a minimal
environment, no shell, and no persistence responsibility. Non-Windows execution fails closed.

These controls do not restrict filesystem or network access, establish an OS sandbox, protect
managed files from a process with write access, or prove sample authenticity. Managed storage is not
authenticated chain of custody. A path/open race remains despite link/reparse checks and source
identity comparisons. ZIP central-directory parsing is skipped and reported partial; reaching
string/indicator caps is also partial. A database failure after exclusive object publication leaves
an unexplained object for operator review; reconciliation never deletes it. Recovery restores
metadata but never reconstructs missing sample bytes from registry originals. B1 has no retention
policy, route-level authorization surface, or sample-byte API. Job Object association does not cover
children launched through every alternate Windows system service; the tree claim covers processes
Windows associates with this Job Object.

## Stage B1 definition of done

- [x] Explicit local registry, configured managed storage, bounded managed-copy intake, and opaque
  non-overwriting object publication.
- [x] Additive Alembic revision, separate sample and analysis records, bounded result/audit records,
  atomic queue reservation/claim, and metadata-only backup/recovery behavior.
- [x] Fixed worker entry point with verified Windows Job Object controls, timeout, bounded output,
  cleanup paths, and fail-closed unsupported-host behavior.
- [x] Synthetic regression coverage for limits, mutation, publication failure, timeout/output,
  process-tree termination, migration, restart reconciliation, and missing-object recovery.
- [x] Operating documentation, audit, and verification report updated.
- [ ] B2 requires separate approval for authenticated routes, result disclosure, UI/case links,
  retention/deletion, queue shutdown/cancellation, and any browser transfer of sample bytes.

## Release verification — 2026-10-27

Release candidate includes Stage A log-analysis jobs and the backend-only B1 managed-copy worker.
No incomplete B2 routes, browser sample transfers, retention/deletion controls, or sandbox guarantees
are included. The CI workflow now has a scoped Windows worker-acceptance job for actual Job Object
checks and an explicit frontend dependency audit after `npm ci --no-audit`.

An initial full Python run returned 146 passed and 3 failed (with the same five deselected): the
synthetic child-process tree did not start in one Job Object test, and two backup publication checks
hit Windows `WinError 5`. The managed-malware suite then passed all 19 tests in isolation, including
the actual synthetic process-tree check, and the complete sequential rerun passed all 149 selected
tests. A later diagnostic pair of simultaneous pytest invocations also collided because both used the
shared `tests/.pytest-tmp` path; those overlapping results were discarded. The browser suite passed on
its isolated rerun after one session-expiry login timeout during the first run.

The initial GitHub Actions run for `eb04cdfabae9be41409e4682e19a2f33b3c265eb` is recorded at
<https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40536275930>. Strict mypy failed on Linux because
`ctypes.WinDLL` is absent from Linux's ctypes stubs. The focused correction now resolves `WinDLL`
dynamically and fails closed if unavailable; Linux-platform mypy emulation passes locally. The same
run's Windows managed-malware job, secret scan, and container build/security job passed; the dashboard
browser job and overall workflow were still in progress when the initial failure was diagnosed. The
offline benchmark run for that SHA passed at
<https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40536275831>. Follow-up remote verification of
the correction is required before release checks can be called complete.

## Follow-up security review — 2026-10-27

The follow-up CI run for `480f020e96a97887d8429df3c038fbe1173f91e6` passed its quality,
Windows B1, dashboard, container, and secret-scan jobs. The matching CodeQL analyses and offline
benchmark run also completed successfully:

- CI: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40538024346>
- CodeQL: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40538024315>
- Offline benchmarks: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40538024313>

Review of that commit's CodeQL findings identified legacy TLS versions being permitted by the
domain probe and generated browser-test credentials being printed by the test harness. The current
follow-up changes explicitly require TLS 1.2 or newer and pass generated test credentials through
the harness's stdin pipe while printing only the loopback URL. Local regression and browser tests
pass; remote confirmation is pending for the follow-up commit.

The Trivy report step listed 44 high-severity package matches across eight Debian advisories in the
pinned `python:3.12.15-slim-trixie` image; the blocking policy step passes because none are marked
fixable in the current Trixie package set. Debian's tracker lists fixes only in newer or unstable
package lines for these findings: [ncurses](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-69720),
[systemd](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-16742),
[ACL](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-54369),
[util-linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/util-linux), and
[Perl Archive::Tar](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-9538). Moving the base
image to a newer Debian release or carrying package backports needs a separate security decision.

## Stage B2 resume verification — 2026-10-27

This section records checks rerun against the resumed B2 worktree. It supersedes earlier B2
verification statements where these commands were rerun. Python checks were run in PowerShell with
`$env:PYTHONPATH='C:\src\Chinescan;.venv\Lib\site-packages';` before the listed `py -3.12`
command. The lock check used the repository's `.venv312` executable.

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `py -3.12 --version` | Python 3.12.10 |
| `py -3.12 -m pytest --cov=chinescan --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80` | **Interrupted, not passed:** 105 passed, 5 deselected, then `KeyboardInterrupt` while entering malware worker-control tests; no coverage summary or threshold result was produced. Full-trace localized one interruption to `Thread.start()` waiting on its startup event. |
| `py -3.12 -m pytest --cov=chinescan --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80 -k "not test_worker_control_path_timeout_and_output_overflow_close_pipes"` | **Interrupted, not passed:** 105 passed, 6 deselected, then `KeyboardInterrupt`; no coverage summary. |

### WinError 5 investigation

The captured exception is `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied` from
`os.rename(staging, output)` in `chinescan/core/storage/recovery.py` while publishing a complete
backup staging directory to a destination that did not exist. Two recovery tests in one sequential
run hit this operation. Source and database handles are closed before publication; verification
and hashing use closed file contexts, and failed staging cleanup completed. Pytest uses per-test
`tmp_path` directories. No concurrent Python test process was active during the initial isolated
reproductions; the same B2 recovery test failed once in a sequential focused file run and then passed
when isolated. The parent test directory ACL grants full access to owner, SYSTEM, and administrators;
the current user is non-administrator. The code's `chmod(0700/0600)` calls do not prove Windows ACL
enforcement. No evidence established an open handle, shared path collision, or specific permission
cause. An isolated formerly failing verification test and a later full recovery run passed, but
another earlier full recovery run had two publication failures. No retry or publication semantic
change was made. **Root cause remains unresolved; recovery publication is not fully verified.**

Five optional `real_scanner` cases were deselected by the configured suite because no YARA/ClamAV
binary and signature database were installed or verified. Neither engine was enabled or invoked.
No external submission, new dependency, commit, or push was performed. Windows Job Object controls
are process containment only; they do not provide an OS sandbox or remove filesystem race conditions.

### Release-blocker diagnosis — 2026-10-27

| Status | Result |
| --- | --- |
| B2 browser acceptance | **Passed:** 6/6 in the final full Playwright run; actual Windows contained worker, persisted analysis, case link, redacted report export, refresh, and logout protection. |
| Full Python acceptance | **Incomplete:** every attempted full run ended with `KeyboardInterrupt`; no completed full-suite coverage percentage or threshold result exists. |
| Backup publication reliability | **Unresolved:** earlier recovery tests raised WinError 5 at publication; no root cause or code change established. |
| Release readiness | **Blocked** pending a completed full Python acceptance run and backup publication reliability resolution. |

The verbose managed-malware trace identifies the active item and stack, not a test assertion failure:
17 tests completed, then `KeyboardInterrupt` arrived on the main thread while
`threading.Thread.start()` waited for its new reader thread to initialize. The test patches
`subprocess.Popen` and uses a fake process and fake Job Object; it launches and terminates no real
worker. A temporary signal observer recorded SIGINT (signal 2), with only the main thread present,
within milliseconds of that item's setup hook. In a separate detached run, SIGINT arrived during the
SQLite backup progress callback at `recovery.py` line 562 after 14 tests, so the event is not specific
to the reader-thread test. Repository searches found no signal or console-control operation in this
test file; the explicit fake `KeyboardInterrupt` in `test_external_scanners.py` is unrelated and is
not part of the isolated reproduction. A 20-second Python sleep completed with exit code 0. A
PowerShell background-job attempt ended with Windows status `-1073741510` (`STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT`)
before it wrote its exit file. Console process-list diagnostics showed the pytest process and its
`py.exe` parent attached to a console, but did not identify which host component generated the
control event. Thus a real external/control SIGINT is evidenced; whether its source is the Codex
execution host, its console lifecycle, or another host process is not established. No signal was
suppressed and no worker-control tests were skipped.

A corrected diagnostic loop ran 500 B2-shaped backups serially, each using a unique temporary
directory under the pytest temporary root and valid managed sample/job metadata. It exited 0 with
zero publication errors. Earlier diagnostic wrappers saw two `OSError` events at the wrapped rename
but then raised their own formatting `TypeError`, so they did not preserve the error code or a valid
state snapshot and are excluded as diagnostic evidence. The recorded real test trace from the prior
recovery runs remains `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied` at
`os.rename(staging, output)`. It occurred while the staging directory existed and the destination
was absent; the backup function's cleanup removed staging and left the destination absent. Handles
to the source and destination SQLite connections are closed before publication by code inspection.
The 500-run probe found no failure at which to capture file attributes, same-volume state, or an
OS-level holder list. The cause remains unestablished; no retry, overwrite, weakened integrity
check, or skipped recovery test was introduced.

Smallest next diagnostic action: run the managed-malware focused suite from an independent,
persistent Windows PowerShell session outside the Codex command process group, and return its exit
code plus the failing item/trace if SIGINT recurs. For backup publication, the next failing event
must be captured before cleanup with Windows file attributes and Restart Manager's resource-holder
list; the current isolated 500-run reproduction did not trigger it. Until both signals are resolved,
do not mark the release checks complete.

## CI failure follow-up — 2026-10-28

The screenshot corresponds to GitHub Actions run `40656496453` at commit
`2f5b03500bc93411c3c795901a0e43337ba85a99`. Its three failing checks had distinct causes:

- `quality`: `test_malware_api_fail_closed_and_redacted_case_linking` expected HTTP 422 for an
  unknown registered sample, but got 503 on Linux because the containment-unavailable check ran
  before sample validation. `MalwareDashboardManager.submit` now validates the approved registry
  entry before reporting service/containment availability. A valid sample still fails closed when
  containment is unavailable.
- `dashboard`: the production build passed; one real contained-worker browser test exceeded the
  global 90-second Playwright timeout. That test now has a 180-second budget, above its existing
  120-second job wait.
- `Windows managed malware worker acceptance`: pytest received `KeyboardInterrupt` at
  `threading.Thread.start()` after 17 tests, without an assertion failure. The focused test uses
  synchronous in-memory `BytesIO` streams, so its pipe reader now runs inline; real worker tests
  continue to exercise the actual Windows worker and Job Object.

Local verification after these changes (PowerShell, Python 3.12.10):

| Exact command | Exit | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `$env:PYTHONPATH='C:\src\Chinescan;.venv\Lib\site-packages'; py -3.12 -m pytest tests/unit/test_web_api.py::test_malware_api_fail_closed_and_redacted_case_linking -q` | 0 | 1 passed in 11.67s. |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "actual contained malware triage"` (from `frontend/`) | 0 | 1 passed in 36.3s; actual Windows contained worker, persistence, case link, report redaction, refresh, and logout checks completed. |
| `$env:PYTHONPATH='C:\src\Chinescan;.venv\Lib\site-packages'; py -3.12 -m pytest tests/unit/test_managed_malware.py -q` | 2 | `KeyboardInterrupt` still recurred after 18 passed while entering the next real-worker test. No assertion failed; the source of the interrupt remains unidentified. |
| `$env:PYTHONPATH='C:\src\Chinescan;.venv\Lib\site-packages'; py -3.12 -m pytest tests/unit/test_managed_malware.py::test_actual_windows_contained_worker_returns_bounded_synthetic_result -vv --full-trace` | 0 | 1 passed in 0.73s. |

| `git diff --check` | 0 | Passed. |

The full Windows worker acceptance remains unresolved because of the reproducible external-looking
`KeyboardInterrupt`; the focused real-worker acceptance passes in isolation. No workflow rerun was
started and no commit or push was made.

## CI repair investigation — 2026-10-28

### Baseline

Before edits, `main`, `HEAD`, and `origin/main` were identical at
`a7008f7ec7c6d0db228a02f0e0308af5c6b92aba`; the working tree was clean. The branch had no
protection rule. The earlier screenshot commit was `2f5b03500bc93411c3c795901a0e43337ba85a99`,
but the newest CI run was `40657868171`:

- CI: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40657868171>
- Offline benchmarks: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40657868201>
- Newer push workflow: <https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40659082070>

At `a7008f7`, Linux quality, container, and secret-scan jobs passed; the benchmark and push
workflows passed. The Windows managed-malware job and Linux dashboard/browser job failed.

### Actual failure evidence

| Check | Runner and command | Failure evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows managed malware worker acceptance | Windows Server 2025; Python 3.12.10 installed by locked `uv sync`; `uv run --locked --extra dev pytest tests/unit/test_managed_malware.py -q` | Exit 1. Pytest printed 18 passes, then `KeyboardInterrupt` at `threading.py:355` as the first real worker test started its stdout-reader thread. No assertion failed. The Actions command omitted `--full-trace`; a local full-trace reproduction places the interrupt in `process.py` at `reader.start()` / `threading.Event.wait()`. Its origin remains unknown. |
| Dashboard build and browser acceptance | Ubuntu; Node 22.22.0; `npm run test:e2e` after successful install, audit, typecheck, component tests, build, and Chromium installation | Exit 1. Five tests passed. The malware UI workflow timed out at 180 seconds while clicking a button that the Linux application correctly disables because verified Windows Job Object execution is unavailable. The UI already exposes that capability state. |

GitHub returned no uploaded artifacts for this run, so the referenced Playwright screenshot, error
context, and trace were not retrievable from Actions. No process assertion or backup `WinError 5`
was present in these failure logs.

### Changes in this repair

- The browser acceptance now checks `/api/malware/capability`. On platforms without verified
  containment it asserts the unavailable state and disabled control. When containment is available,
  it continues through the real analysis, persistence, case link, redaction, refresh, and logout
  checks.
- Worker launch now creates the Job Object first, launches the child suspended, verifies its Job
  Object assignment, starts the bounded output reader, and resumes exactly one verified primary
  thread. If thread discovery or resume verification fails, cleanup terminates the assigned child.
  The helper verifies the original process remains alive and that the opened primary thread belongs to that process before resuming it. This ensures the static parser cannot start before containment.
- Added portable Win32 API-control tests for primary-thread discovery/resume and a regression
  assertion that launch uses `CREATE_SUSPENDED` and resumes only after Job assignment.
- CI now runs mocked/control-path tests and the three real Windows worker tests in separate pytest
  processes. All real Windows tests remain enabled; the second step uses `--full-trace`.

On the prior SHA, Linux CI quality passed with 80.40% coverage; the new SHA still needs CI verification. |

Optional real YARA/ClamAV scanner tests remain separately deselected because the required local
binaries and signature data are not installed. No sample was executed outside the fixed static
worker, uploaded, or sent for external enrichment.

This report records investigation and local results only. Remote CI results for the repair commit
must be added after that exact SHA completes.

### First repair commit follow-up — `52c019bbfeea52da7c1d645c9c45f3dcf7548984`

The first repair commit was pushed normally to `main`. Its workflows completed as follows:

- [CI run 40662092608](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40662092608): dashboard/browser, container, and secret scan passed. Quality failed because four parameter cases in the new Win32 thread-control test used `ctypes.wintypes` fields whose widths vary by host ABI; all four failed on Linux.
- The Windows worker job also failed on that run. The mocked step printed `26 passed, 3 deselected in 1.50s` and then Actions reported exit 1 without a traceback or pytest failure summary. The real-worker step did not run. This differs from the earlier logged `KeyboardInterrupt`; its cause is still unknown.
- [Offline benchmarks run 40662092742](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40662092742) passed.
- [Push/security run 40662092322](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40662092322) passed, including CodeQL analyses for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Actions.

The Win32 `THREADENTRY32` mock now uses fixed-width 32-bit fields, matching the Windows API structure on Linux test hosts. The Windows mocked acceptance command now also requests `--full-trace` to capture any hidden pytest interruption on the hosted runner.

Follow-up verification on the working tree:

| Exact command | Exit | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Linux container: `uv run --locked --extra dev python -c "import pytest; raise SystemExit(pytest.main(['tests/unit/test_managed_malware.py::test_resume_suspended_process_requires_one_resumable_primary_thread', '-q']))"` | 0 | 8 passed; fixed-width Win32 structure cases pass on Linux. Container used Python 3.12.16; pytest emitted only the expected cache warning because the repository mount was read-only. |

### Second repair commit verification — `23f4e6103ee072d6086fc0dbf7747389c8d8cf1d`

The second repair commit was pushed normally to `main`. Its workflows completed as follows:

- [CI run 40663199017](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40663199017): quality passed, including coverage; dashboard/browser, container, and secret scan passed. Windows managed-malware acceptance failed.
- [Offline benchmarks run 40663199001](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40663199001) passed.
- [Push/security run 40663198825](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40663198825) passed, including CodeQL analyses for Actions, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript.

The Windows job ran on Windows Server 2025 with Python 3.12.10. Exact failed command:

`uv run --locked --extra dev pytest tests/unit/test_managed_malware.py -q -k "not test_actual_windows_contained_worker_returns_bounded_synthetic_result and not test_actual_windows_manager_persists_contained_synthetic_analysis and not test_actual_job_object_terminates_synthetic_child_process_tree" --full-trace`

It printed `26 passed, 3 deselected in 1.22s`, then Actions reported exit code 1. `--full-trace`
produced no traceback or pytest failure. The actual Windows containment tests did not run because
the first step failed. Reproduction on the local Windows host also prints passing summaries and
returns exit 1 for some multi-test selections, while individual selections return 0. The pytest
session reports exit code 0 when invoked via `pytest.main`, so the exit-status change occurs outside
pytest's reported result. Its source remains unidentified; no workaround was applied.

Current verification is therefore incomplete: the Windows managed-malware acceptance check is
still failing on the pushed SHA. This report does not claim that all required checks passed.

### Windows liveness fix — local verification before push

The Windows exit-status failure was traced to `MalwareJobManager.reconcile()` calling
`_pid_is_alive()`, which used `os.kill(pid, 0)`. Python documents that on Windows signal value `0`
is `CTRL_C_EVENT`, which targets console processes sharing a console; it is not a no-signal process
probe ([Python `os.kill` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.kill)). This
explains the observed `KeyboardInterrupt` during the prior worker acceptance run and the exit 1
after a passing pytest summary. The Windows path now opens the PID with `SYNCHRONIZE` access and
checks its state using `WaitForSingleObject`; inconclusive access or wait errors preserve the job
as potentially active. POSIX retains its `os.kill(pid, 0)` liveness check. Portable API tests cover
running, exited, inaccessible, and inconclusive states. The implementation requests only the
`SYNCHRONIZE` process right required by [OpenProcess](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess)
and uses [WaitForSingleObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitforsingleobject)
with a zero timeout.

The full Windows Python acceptance also exposed a separate test timing issue: logout and CSRF
assertions shared a one-second session TTL with the expiry test, so on the slower full-suite run
the session expired before logout. The tests are now separated: logout uses the normal TTL, while
actual expiry remains checked independently.

The last pushed SHA `d806d55e9f31542de42ab4be4f00bf642d36f260` passed quality, dashboard/browser,
container, secret scan, offline benchmarks, and all CodeQL analyses; its Windows worker step failed
before this liveness fix. Remote verification for the next SHA is pending and must complete before
claiming the Windows failure is fixed in CI.

### First liveness-fix CI run — `095be27430a79a4cfbce41b60f66df626d6576f7`

- [CI run 40709926208](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40709926208): Windows managed-malware acceptance passed, including the mocked-control step and all three actual Windows containment tests. Dashboard/browser, container, and secret scan passed. Quality failed at Linux mypy before running pytest: Linux ctypes type stubs do not declare `WinDLL` or `get_last_error`.
- [Offline benchmarks run 40709925897](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40709925897) passed.
- [Push/security run 40709926727](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40709926727) passed all three CodeQL analyses.

The Windows API symbols now use guarded `getattr` lookups. If the API is unavailable or an error
is inconclusive, recovery conservatively treats the process as alive instead of marking its job
interrupted. After this adjustment, local mypy passes for all 52 source files, Ruff passes, and the
complete managed-malware test file passes (35 passed on Windows). Remote verification of the
corrected typing and final SHA is recorded below.

### Verified liveness-fix SHA — `791cf7266333db10cd95fadda121311ebf7a23e2`

The final code commit was pushed normally to `main`; all configured workflows passed for this exact
SHA:

- [CI run 40710401322](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40710401322): quality (including coverage), Windows managed-malware acceptance, dashboard/browser acceptance, container, and secret scan all passed.
- [Offline benchmarks run 40710401288](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40710401288) passed.
- [Push/security run 40710398300](https://github.com/CipherChi/Chinescan/actions/runs/40710398300) passed CodeQL for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Actions.

The Windows job completed both mocked/control-path acceptance and all three actual contained
worker/process-tree tests. The Linux quality job completed Ruff, strict mypy, 168 unit tests with
