# Phase 0 verification report

## Files created

- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` — records checkout orientation and observed platform/tool availability.
- `docs/plans/phase-1.md` — repository assessment, proposed Phase 1 tree/dependencies/order, risks, assumptions, and recommended defaults for owner decisions.
- `docs/reports/phase-0-report.md` — this phase's verification summary.

## Commands run

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `git -C C:\src rev-parse --show-toplevel` | Exit 0; `C:/src`. |
| `git -C C:\src status --short --branch` | Exit 0; `main...origin/main` and six untracked sibling directories. |
| `git -C C:\src ls-files` | Exit 0; `README.md`. |
| `python --version` | Exit 0; `Python 3.10.11`. |
| `docker --version` | Exit 0; `Docker version 29.9.2, build a82e528`. |
| `pip --version` | Exit 0; `pip 23.0.1` for Python 3.10. |
| `uv --version` | Not available; command not found. |
| `semgrep --version` | Not available; command not found. |
| `Get-Command` availability check for `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `hadolint` | Not available; executables not found on PATH. |
| `py -0` | Exit 0; Python 3.13, 3.11, and 3.10 listed; no 3.12 entry. |
| `py -3.12 --version` | Exit 1; `No suitable Python runtime found`. |

The environment probe also attempted `rg --files` over `C:\src`; it traversed large unrelated untracked sibling trees and produced excessive output. No files in those sibling projects were changed. The project inventory was therefore taken from the Git index (`git ls-files`) and direct inspection of the root README.

## Commands not run

- `docker info` and `docker build`: Phase 0 does not build implementation artifacts; daemon availability is still unknown.
- Test, lint, type-check, install, and scanner commands: no project implementation or environment is present; these belong to Phase 1.
- Scanner versions beyond Semgrep: not required to plan the Phase 1 platform foundation.

## Decisions

The owner approved the plan with updated decisions: create a separate Git repository at `C:\src\Chinescan`; require Python 3.12+ and defer Phase 1 coding until launcher checks pass; constrain direct dependencies and resolve exact versions using `uv.lock`; include `pip-audit` and `tomli-w`; use Apache-2.0, platform config/data paths, and the shared-finding model design; allow Docker build to be NOT RUN under Option B only with the daemon error recorded. See [Phase 1 plan](../plans/phase-1.md).

## Known limitations and security

- The launched working directory `C:\src\Chinescan` is empty; Git root is `C:\src`. The plan uses Git root and flags this for review.
- The Python launcher has 3.13, 3.11, and 3.10, but no Python 3.12. The required `py -3.12 --version` check failed, so Phase 1 is blocked by the owner's explicit start condition.
- Docker CLI availability does not establish that its daemon is reachable.
- No application code, configuration, dependency, or scanner was added or run. Untracked sibling projects remain outside the ChineScan inventory.

## Definition of Done

- [x] Repository orientation recorded in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.
- [x] Phase 1 plan recorded in `docs/plans/phase-1.md`.
- [x] No implementation code or configuration added.
- [x] Work stopped at Phase 0 pending the mandatory Python 3.12 launcher check.
- [ ] Python 3.12 interpreter confirmed (FAIL: not installed; see `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`).

## Recommended next step

Install Python 3.12, then rerun `py -0` and `py -3.12 --version` and record the successful output in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`. Only then initialize the standalone Git repository inside `C:\src\Chinescan` and begin Phase 1; do not stage ChineScan into the parent checkout.
