# Phase 5 verification report

Recorded 2026-10-26 in `C:\src\Chinescan` with Python 3.12.10.

## Outcome and boundary

This is a partial Phase 5 delivery. `chinescan malware analyze <path>` performs bounded,
non-executing static triage of one local regular file up to 64 MiB. It reports MD5, SHA-1,
SHA-256, best-effort PE/ELF/PDF/OLE/ZIP/TAR/GZIP signatures, a printable-string count without
string contents, bounded ZIP member metadata without extraction, and candidate IP/domain/URL/email
indicators. Indicator values are hidden unless `--include-indicators` is provided. YARA and
ClamAV are optional local integrations selected explicitly with `--yara-rules` and `--clamav`.

The repository instruction says not to claim malware intake/storage is implemented. The analyzer
therefore does not copy, quarantine, encrypt, retain, or persist samples or results. This phase
does not meet the complete original Phase 5 acceptance requirement for safe sample intake and
storage. Memory analysis and dynamic detonation remain explicit exit-2 stubs.

| `git diff --check` | 0 | No whitespace errors; Git emitted standard LF-to-CRLF working-tree notices. |

YARA and ClamAV executables were not installed on PATH in this environment. Their adapter behavior
was checked with mocked executable discovery and process results, including match-name filtering
and timeout handling; no real signature engine run was performed.

## Security and limitations

- The analyzer rejects symlinks, non-regular files, and files exceeding 64 MiB, hashes data read
  once in bounded chunks, and checks file identity/size/modification time before and after the
  read. The file remains only in memory for metadata extraction; no output contains arbitrary
  extracted strings.
- ZIP member listing is capped at 1,000 entries. No archive member is extracted or recursively
  analyzed. File signatures and PDF/Office markers are heuristic indicators, not parser-grade
  validation or a malware verdict.
- External engines are opt-in, local-only adapters using argument vectors, no shell, a restricted
  environment, 30-second timeouts, and bounded merged output. Their rule definitions and database
  freshness are the operator's responsibility.
- Extracted indicators and scanner matches are candidate evidence requiring analyst validation.
- Malware intake/storage, encrypted sample retention, strict sample access control, YARA recursive
  archive analysis, rich PE/ELF/Office/PDF parsers, memory analysis, IOC enrichment, and sandbox
  execution are not implemented.

## Definition of done

- [x] Bounded local hashing and common signature identification are implemented without executing
  a submitted file.
- [x] Candidate static indicators, printable-string counts, and bounded ZIP metadata are
  available without storing analysis records.
- [x] Optional YARA/ClamAV adapters use explicit opt-in and bounded local subprocess controls.
- [x] CLI exposes static analysis and keeps memory/detonation as usage-code-2 stubs.
- [x] Python 3.12, Ruff, strict mypy, tests/coverage, pip-audit, Bandit's CI threshold, Compose,
  fixture CLI, and Docker image checks pass.
- [ ] Safe sample intake and storage remain unimplemented by design and block completion of the
  full Phase 5 definition of done.

## Stage B1 superseding addendum — 2026-10-27

The original report describes the pre-B1 implementation. Stage B1 now adds the approved backend-only
operator registry, managed-copy intake, persisted malware records, recovery reconciliation, and
fixed Windows Job Object worker. ZIP central-directory inspection is skipped and reported as partial;
the earlier claim of bounded ZIP metadata is no longer current. Browser intake/download routes,
case-link UI, retention/deletion controls, memory analysis, and dynamic analysis remain outside this
slice. Exact B1 acceptance is recorded in `phase-1-report.md`; backend operations are in
`../MALWARE-BACKEND.md`.
